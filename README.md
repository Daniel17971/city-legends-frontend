## ENVIROMENT VARIABLES

To start interacting with the databases localy you have to create the environment variables(which you do not have initially for security reasons).

- To create them create a .env file in your project root folder (see .env-example for reference) and include:
  - a variable with the database url
  - a variable with the firebase api key
