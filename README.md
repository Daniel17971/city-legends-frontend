## ENVIROMENT VARIABLES

To start interacting with the databases localy you have to create the environment variables(which you do not have initially for security reasons).

- To create them create the two .env files in your project root folder (see .env-example for reference):
  - .env.development - to contain a variable with dev database url and firebase api key
  - .env.test - to contain a variable with dev database url and firebase api key
